  {@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.processing.GridCoverageProcessor Grid coverage processor}
  (image processing functionality). The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-004.pdf">OpenGIS&reg;
  Grid Coverages Implementation Specification</A>.

  <P ALIGN="justify">The following are examples of grid coverage processing operations.
  This list is not an exhaustive list. Different {@link org.opengis.coverage.processing.GridCoverageProcessor}
  implementations will provide different operations and need not implement the entire list below.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">Using one of these operations to change the way the grid is being accessed
  will not affect the state of the grid coverage controlled by another operations. For example,
  changing the interpolation method should not affect the number of sample dimensions currently
  being accessed or value sequence.</P>
